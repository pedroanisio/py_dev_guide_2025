# py_dev_guide_2025

Welcome to **py_dev_guide_2025**, the definitive guide to Python development best practices for 2025. This comprehensive resource provides actionable recommendations for building high-quality, modern Python applications, covering everything from environment setup to AI and data science workflows.

Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, this guide is designed for Python developers aiming to follow industry-standard practices in 2025.

## üéØ Purpose

**py_dev_guide_2025** is your go-to reference for:

- Setting up reproducible Python environments with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and Python 3.13.
- Writing clean, maintainable code with `PEP 8`, [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), and type hinting.
- Designing robust applications using SOLID principles and [`Pydantic v2`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).
- Testing effectively with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Containerizing applications with Docker and deploying with confidence.
- Building APIs with [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), managing tasks with [`Celery`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/), and persisting data with modern databases.
- Implementing AI and data science pipelines using tools like [`Ollama`](https://ollama.ai/) and [`MLflow`](https://mlflow.org/).

Whether you're a solo developer or part of a team, this guide helps you craft elegant, scalable Python software.

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedroanisio/py_dev_guide_2025.git
cd py_dev_guide_2025
````

(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install MkDocs and dependencies:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

### Serve Locally

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Build for Deployment

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This generates the static site in the `site/` directory, ready to deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or another platform.
